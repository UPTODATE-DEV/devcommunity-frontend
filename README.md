## About
Dev Community is a platform that brings together developers from diverse backgrounds and skillsets to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and support each other's growth. Our mission is to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where developers can connect, learn, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Features
- **Community-driven:** Dev Community is powered by the collective efforts of our passionate contributors. Together, we shape the direction and growth of the community.
- **Project Collaboration:** Join forces with fellow developers to work on exciting open-source projects. Contribute your skills and gain valuable experience.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Share your expertise, insights, and tutorials with the community through articles, blog posts, and interactive discussions.

## Project Structure
This project is a frontend-only application built with React, Next.js, and TypeScript. Below is a brief overview of the main files and folders:

- **`public/`**: Contains static files such as images, fonts, and other assets that will be publicly accessible.
- **`src/`**: The core of the application, where you'll find all the source code, including components, pages, and utilities.
- **`worker/`**: This folder is intended for web workers, if your project requires background processing.
- **`.env` & `.env.example`**: Environment configuration files. The `.env` file contains sensitive data like API keys and should be kept secret. The `.env.example` file provides a template for setting up your environment.
- **`.eslintrc.json`**: Configuration file for ESLint, a tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, ensuring sensitive or unnecessary files are not tracked.
- **`README.md`**: This document, providing an overview of the project, how to set it up, and how to contribute.
- **`headers.js`**: Manages custom HTTP headers for enhanced security and performance.
- **`next-sitemap.config.js`**: Configuration file for generating sitemaps with Next.js.
- **`next.config.js`**: Next.js configuration file, where you can customize the framework's behavior.
- **`package-lock.json` & `package.json`**: These files track the project's dependencies and their versions.
- **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**: Lockfile for managing dependencies if you're using PNPM as your package manager.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript, specifying compiler options and settings.
